Function `checkrp` which does consistency checks and possibly recycles the reference to fit to the
predictions is now exported. This saves time if multiple performance measures are to be calculated on
the same predictions.

<!-- end excerpt --> 

{% highlight rconsole %}
> sens (r = ref, p = pred)
       A    B  C
[1,] 0.6 0.32 NA
Warnmeldung:
In checkrp(r, p) : colnames of r (ABC) and p  (abc) do not match.
{% endhighlight %}
`sens` automatically calls `checkrp` as you can see by the warning it throws.

To disable this, execute `checkrp` beforehand and tell `sens` that this was done already:
{% highlight rconsole %}
> ref <- checkrp (r = ref, p = pred)
Warnmeldung:
In checkrp(r = ref, p = pred) :
  colnames of r (ABC) and p  (abc) do not match.
> sens (r = ref, p = pred, .checked = TRUE)
       A    B  C
[1,] 0.6 0.32 NA
{% endhighlight %}
