Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumours. During neurosurgical treatment, locating the
exact tumour border is often difficult. This study assesses grading of astrocytomas based on Raman
spectroscopy for a future application in intra-surgical guidance.
 
<!-- end excerpt -->
Our predictive classification models distinguish the surgically relevant classes "normal tissue" and
"low" and "high grade astrocytoma" in Raman maps of moist bulk samples (80 patients) acquired with a
fibre-optic probe. We introduce partial class memberships as a strategy to utilize borderline cases
for classification. Borderline cases supply the most valuable training and test data for our
application. They are (a) examples of the sought boundary and (b) the cases for which new diagnostics
are needed. Besides, the number of suitable training samples increases considerably: soft logistic
regression (LR) utilizes 85% more spectra and 50% more patients than linear discriminant analysis
(LDA). The predictive soft LR models achieve ca. 85, 67 and 84% (normal, low and high grade)
sensitivity and specificity. We discuss the different heuristics of LR and LDA in the light of
borderline samples. While we focus on prediction, the spectroscopic interpretation of the predictive
models agrees with previous descriptive studies. Unsaturated lipids are used to differentiate between
normal and tumour tissues, while the total lipid content prominently contributes to the determination
of the tumour grade. The high-wavenumber region above 2,800 cm<sup>-1</sup> alone did not allow
successful grading. We give a proof of concept for Raman spectroscopic grading of moist astrocytoma
tissues and propose to include borderline samples into classifier training and testing.
