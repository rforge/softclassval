title: Slight overhaul to keep up with R and roxygen2
tags: news
---

Some updates were necessary because of new requirements for R's package infrastructure.
None of these updates affects calculations or other user visible behaviour.

<!-- end excerpt -->
Details: 

- The citation was updated, 
- Documentation adapted to `roxygen2`,
- `svUnit` for the unit tests is now in the `Imports:` rather than the `Suggests:` section of the `DESCRIPTION` file.

Of course, this is accompanied by a version bump with the minor version indicating today's date.
